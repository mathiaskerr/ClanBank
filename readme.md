ClanBank

Clanbank is a spending tracker which helps you keep track and organise your spending.

The brief was to build an app where the user can keep track of their spending.

ClanBank can:

    Create and edt merchants
    Assign tags and merchants to transactions
    View all transactions

Extras if there was time:
    Be able to mark merchant as inactive
    Sort transactions by date
    To filter transactions by merchants or tags 


The Home Page:
![Home page](static/screenshots/home_page.png?raw=true "Home Page")

further work would see the home page updated with a different fact each day.
